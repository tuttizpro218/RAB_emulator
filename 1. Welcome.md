# ATTENTION!!! READ BELOW!!!
RAB (RealAndroidBot) is made for PHONE users, not dedicated for emulators.
First of all, you need a 64 bit version of Windows for the bot!


Works with Bluestacks 4/5 and with LDPlayer!

I don't know why 5 has the gps issue for me. That's the reason why i use version 4!

Big THANKS to RAB and Frank who made this bot!
