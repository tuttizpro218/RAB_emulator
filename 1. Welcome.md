# ATTENTION!!! READ BELOW!!!
RAB (RealAndroidBot) is made for PHONE users, not dedicated for emulators, but you can also use it with emulators too (bluestacks, ldplayer, etc).
First of all, you need a 64 bit version of Windows for the bot!


Sadly now only Bluestacks working (4 , 5)!
I don't know why 5 has the gps issue...
