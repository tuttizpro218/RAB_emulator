# ATTENTION!!! READ BELOW!!!
RAB (RealAndroidBot) is made for PHONE users, not exactly for emulators, but yes you can also use it with emulators too (bluestacks, ldplayer, etc).
First of all, you need a 64 bit version of Windows for the bot!

Sometimes PokemonGO INSTANTLY CRASHES WHEN YOU START! To fix it, just go to the app settings and clear your cache (I also get this bug pretty often).



# What you need to start using RAB with emulator
1. You need an Emulator. (I use Bluestacks 4 https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html | download the Bluestacks 4 Nougat 32 Bit version)

27. --------------------------------------------------------------- THESE STEPS ARE ONLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TEST SOME FEATURE STUFF, IF RAB PUSHES YOU TO GET A NEW VERSION LIKE 1.5 -> 1.6
28. Go to RAB's discord. (https://discord.gg/Xw2DKBhRJu)        YOU DON'T NEED THIS STEP, THANK YOU.
29. Go to #roles then type !register tester.
30. You will get 3 new channels: go on #alpha-dev-download.
31. Download the newest version.
32. ---------------------------------------------------------------
33. Extract the zip to the RAB directory.
34. If you are already logged in to PokemonGO then you must change the settings like this to avoid getting banned!

41. And if you did everything right, then hopefully you are good to go. If you have any problems try to use #emulator / #help. If you can't find the problem then ask for it, you just need to scroll up. Thanks.
