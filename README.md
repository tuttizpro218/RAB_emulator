# ATTENTION!!! READ BELOW!!!
RAB (RealAndroidBot) is made for PHONE users, not dedicated for emulators, but you can also use it with emulators too (bluestacks, ldplayer, etc).
First of all, you need a 64 bit version of Windows for the bot!

Sometimes PokemonGO INSTANTLY CRASHES WHEN YOU START! To fix it there is the fix: https://youtu.be/c6_PjrrOF7w ,
it's needed root! (no you can't use pokemod or any method to play with rab only pgsharp) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPU9oVrM0WQ .



# Follow all the steps to start using RAB with emulator
1. You need an Emulator. (I use Bluestacks 4 https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html | download the Bluestacks 4 Nougat 32 bit version)
